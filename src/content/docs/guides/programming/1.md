## What is Programming?

Programming is the process of creating instructions for computers to follow. Think of it as writing a recipe that a computer can understand and execute.

## Why Learn Programming?

- **Problem Solving**: Develop logical thinking skills
- **Career Opportunities**: High demand in the job market
- **Creativity**: Build apps, games, and websites
- **Automation**: Make repetitive tasks easier

## Programming Languages Overview

### Beginner-Friendly Languages

**Python**
- Easy to read and write
- Great for beginners
- Used in web development, data science, AI

**Java**
- Object-oriented programming
- Popular in enterprise applications
- TuringClub's main focus language

**JavaScript**
- Essential for web development
- Runs in browsers and servers
- Very versatile

## Setting Up Your Environment

### Step 1: Choose a Text Editor
- **VS Code** (Recommended for beginners)
- **IntelliJ IDEA** (Great for Java)
- **PyCharm** (Perfect for Python)

### Step 2: Install Programming Language
For Java (our focus):
1. Download JDK from Oracle
2. Install and set up PATH
3. Verify installation: `java --version`

### Step 3: Write Your First Program
```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, TuringClub!");
    }
}
```

## Basic Programming Concepts

### Variables
Store data for later use:
```java
int age = 20;
String name = "Alice";
boolean isStudent = true;
```

### Control Structures
Make decisions in your code:
```java
if (age >= 18) {
    System.out.println("You are an adult");
} else {
    System.out.println("You are a minor");
}
```

### Loops
Repeat actions:
```java
for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
    System.out.println("Count: " + i);
}
```

## Your First Challenge

Try creating a program that:
1. Asks for your name
2. Asks for your favorite programming language
3. Prints a personalized welcome message
